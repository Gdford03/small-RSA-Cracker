This is was a group project that started in math and the project has been finished for a while. We had a bunch of functions kinda scattered all over the place or commented out and 
I wanted to put them all togather in hope to make it easier to use although it would take forever to solve a full RSA encrption in can solve smaller ones. I also wanted pratice
makeing a GUI and thought a loading screen would be easy to make and would allow me to put this project togather neatly.
